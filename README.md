# Weather

Assignment: Create two visualizations of current conditions, one text-free (graphics-only) and the other text-only.

## Graphical Weather

I went above and beyond on this assignment, breaking free of the typical 2D graphics of p5.js with some low-level WebGL shader code for some nature-inspired effects. From water ripples to drifting clouds to light rays, each graphical nuance is packed with information: wind direction, cloud cover, even moon phase. Plus, a hourly forecast as animated slices of space.

## Text-only Weather

With subtle use of motion blur and animated "particles", text and tone fill the role of graphic elements in this minimal monochrome visualization.
